# blockchain-hash-chain-visualizer
🚀 Blockchain Hash Chain Visualizer An interactive web-based tool to visualize how blockchain works — using SHA-256 hashing to link blocks and demonstrate immutability in a simple and intuitive way.

# 🧠 Features
📥 Add custom data (like "Ahmed") to create new blocks

🔐 Each block generates a unique SHA-256 hash

🔗 Blocks are linked via previous hashes, just like a real blockchain

❌ Chain breaks if tampering occurs — showing why blockchain is secure

🧊 Genesis block created automatically

🎨 Clean, responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML / CSS — Frontend structure & styling

JavaScript — Blockchain logic

CryptoJS — SHA-256 hashing

GitHub Pages — Live deployment
